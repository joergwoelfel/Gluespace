This repository is based upon Chapter 13 "External effects and I/O" of "Functional Programming in Scala" by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason.

While that chapter illustrates crafting an embedded domain-specific language (EDSL), here a very first step is taken towards an embedded general-purpose language (EPSL).

The fundament of a programming language is a function. So we first construct a function, which is lifted to a `Component` - the Result as well as the parameters. So we yield functional composabilty on a lifted level.

`Function1[T, R]` -> `Function1[Component[S, T], Component[S, R]]` see FunctionComponent.scala

`Component[S, T]` corresponds in the book to Console[T]. We have enriched our `Component` by a type parameter `S`, which allows us to abtract the `ConsoleState[A]` of the book to an abitrary `State[S, A]` Monad.

Based upon that fundamental shift, it is planned to develop a complete object orientd general purpose language, which abstract from its persistence implementation. Something like an object relational mapper (ORM) but avoiding all the drawbacks and surpassing its capabilities.

Just start in your IDE the main routine contained in application/Main.scala.
